# MySQL Data Warehouse Project

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project demonstrates how to design and build a **Data Warehouse using MySQL** by following a layered architecture commonly used in real-world data engineering projects.  

The goal of this project is to transform raw operational data into **business-ready analytical data** that can be used for reporting and decision-making.

## 🏗 Data Warehouse Architecture  

### 🥉 Bronze Layer  
- Stores raw data loaded directly from CSV files  
- No transformations are applied  
- Acts as the source of truth  

### 🥈 Silver Layer  
- Cleans and standardizes the raw data  
- Handles data quality issues such as nulls, duplicates, and formatting  
- Prepares data for analytical modeling  

### 🥇 Gold Layer  
- Contains business-ready **fact and dimension views**  
- Designed using a **star schema**  
- Used for analytics and reporting  

---

## 📊 Data Model  
- Star schema design  
- Fact table for sales transactions  
- Dimension tables for customers and products  
- Optimized for analytical queries and reporting  

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used
